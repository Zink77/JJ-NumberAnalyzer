### Background

## Installation/Use
In order to use this code, you will need a Java Compiler (linked the Support section). From there you will be able to use one of two methods to access this code: 
1. If you are trained in accessing github files directly from your code, you may simply copy the link to my exact code files and run them from there.
2. If you are new to coding in Java, I recommend you simply:
    - Highlight all the code listed in my .java file
    - Right click
    - Left click "copy"
    - Enter your java file
    - Right click
    - Left click "paste"
3. For both methods make sure to save your file before compiling.
